What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."

        "\n",
        "Pricing Strategy: If we find that shorter lead times correspond to higher ADRs, the hotel can capitalize on last-minute bookings by adjusting prices upward as the check-in date approaches. For instance, if ADR increases by $10 for every 10 days closer to the arrival date, this can be a significant revenue-boosting strategy.\n",
        "Promotions and Discounts: If longer lead times are associated with lower ADRs, the hotel can offer early bird discounts to encourage early bookings, ensuring higher occupancy rates well in advance. For example, offering a 10% discount for bookings made 60 days in advance might be a strategic move.\n",
        "Revenue Management: Understanding the relationship helps in forecasting and revenue management. Knowing that, on average, bookings made within 7 days of arrival have an ADR 20% higher than those made 30 days in advance can inform dynamic pricing models and yield management strategies.\n",

        "**Potential negative insights could include:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Discount Overuse: If the analysis shows that the majority of bookings are made at lower ADRs due to early booking discounts, the hotel may need to reconsider the depth and breadth of these discounts to avoid underpricing.\n",
        "Last-Minute Booking Risks: Heavy reliance on last-minute bookings at higher ADRs could be risky if market conditions change, leading to a sudden drop in occupancy. The hotel might need to balance last-minute pricing with ensuring a steady flow of advance bookings.\n",
        "Customer Perception: Significant fluctuations in ADR based on lead time might impact customer perception. If guests notice substantial price differences for the same room, it could lead to dissatisfaction or a sense of unfairness."
